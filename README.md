## Overview

This is a softare and hardare project that is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi 3.  Its purpose in life is to allow the user to control a programmable LED light strip using the power output from a Wahoo KICKR trainer over the ANT+ protocol.  In other words, if you pedal easy, the LEDs will be green, but if pedal hard the LEDs will turn red, orange or even yellow.
